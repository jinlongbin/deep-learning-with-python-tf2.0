    "여기서 볼 수 있듯이 낮은 온도는 아주 반복적이고 예상되는 텍스트를 만듭니다. 하지만 국부적인 구조는 매우 실제와 같습니다. 특히 모든 단어(단어는 글자의 지역 패턴으로 이루어집니다)가 실제 영어 단어입니다. 높은 온도에서 생성된 텍스트는 아주 흥미롭고 놀라우며 창의적이기도 합니다. 이따금 꽤 그럴싸하게 보이는 완전히 새로운 단어를 창조합니다(‘begarmed’와 ‘isharent’ 같은 단어입니다). 높은 온도에서는 국부적인 구조가 무너지기 시작합니다. 대부분의 단어가 어느정도 무작위한 문자열로 보입니다. 확실히 이 네트워크에서는 텍스트 생성에 가장 좋은 온도는 0.5입니다. 항상 다양한 샘플링 전략으로 실험해 봐야합니다! 학습된 구조와 무작위성 사이에 균형을 잘 맞추면 흥미로운 것을 만들 수 있습니다.\n",
